# My own Coronavirus/COVID-19 project

- This is not a disrespectful project for the deads or  infected cases.

- I just want to inform with true data and not fake news about new cases or total cases.

#### FULL RESPECT FOR ALL THE INFECTED  AND DEATH PEOPLE.
    HOPE ALL OF YOU ARE GETTING GREAT, WE CAN BEAT IT.
