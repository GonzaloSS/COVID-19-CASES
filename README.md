# My own Coronavirus/COVID-19 project

- This is not a disrespectful project for the deads or  infected cases.

- I just want to inform with true data and not fake news about new cases or total cases.

#### FULL RESPECT FOR ALL THE INFECTED  AND DEATH PEOPLE.
    HOPE ALL OF YOU ARE GETTING GREAT, WE CAN BEAT IT.



## RESOURCES FOR THIS PROJECT:
    On this project I'm using XML, XLS, XSD, HTML5 and finally Open Data.

    For the First Commit I will add on this repository 
      the link of this Open Data, It's 100% credible because     
      it's an oficial opendata give it by the Europe UnioN and one  XSL to transform the XML onto another XML.


    For the Second Commit I add a XSD to Validate the XML, one XSL to transform the original link into a HTML page, host the html and finally a dinamic XSL with JavaScript  into the firebase host page.
